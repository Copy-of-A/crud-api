# crud-api

Assignment for the task is [here](https://github.com/AlreadyBored/nodejs-assignments/blob/main/assignments/crud-api/assignment.md)

All the changes are in **development** branch

I have not commited `.env` file, so to check it you have to created and provide `PORT=3000` or any other value

But it will work without `.env` file as well


## Install dependencies

```
npm i
```

## Run development mode

```
npm run start:dev
```

## Run production mode

```
npm run start:prod
```

## Run unit tests with scenarios

P.S. To test endpoints you can use Postman.postman-for-vscode
